## Dungeon-Test

#### What is this?

This is the base for a small dungeon exploration game written in `C++`, based on the original engine of [Prelude of the Chambered](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ld48/index.html) by __Notch__, which he originally made for the 21st _Ludum Dare_ competition back in August of 2011.

#### What do I need to compile and run this?

You will need the [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [SDL 2 Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) libraries to run it. There is a quick makefile in there, so a `make all` should suffice (you can `make clean` to remove the executable and all `.o` files).

#### Why did you make this?

I originally made this for fun and out of boredom during the late months of 2015. I never really cared about making a real game out of it or something (I never do), so therefore I never continued it beyond the state where it is now.

#### How does it work?

I don't know. Probably magic.

#### Can I use it?

Sure, not all of it is my code (most of the rendering code comes directly from _Prelude of the Chambered_), and if you can read/understand my code and think it's useful, go ahead.

#### I can't read your code, can you help me?

I never write code for anyone but myself, so that means that most of the code is uncommented, unstructured and illegible. If you don't understand what's going on, I suggest you either use the original source code [here](https://github.com/skeeto/Prelude-of-the-Chambered), or use a different system/engine/library, since what's in here is not perfect or even fully working.

#### Can I fix/continue from/branch from your repo?

If you like :), as long as you document your commits and your code (maybe I will one day add comments to all my lines).
